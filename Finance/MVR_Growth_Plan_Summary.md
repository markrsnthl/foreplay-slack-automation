# MVR Digital Growth Plan: Path to $150K/Month

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** ~$95K/month revenue, ~$45K/month expenses, ~$50K/month NOI (52% margin)

**Target State:** $150K/month revenue, ~$80K/month expenses, ~$70K/month NOI (47% margin)

**Key Insight:** You can grow profitably, but the sequence matters. Hire only when revenue triggers are hit.

## The Math That Matters

### Current Monthly P&L (Estimated)

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Revenue | $95,000 |
| Core Team (Maya + Santi + Leah) | $6,300 |
| Contract Labor | $28,000 |
| Operating Expenses | $10,500 |
| **Total Expenses** | **$44,800** |
| **Net Operating Income** | **$50,200** |
| **Operating Margin** | **52.8%** |

### After Two New Deals Close ($25K combined)

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Revenue | $120,000 |
| Same Expenses | $44,800 |
| **Net Operating Income** | **$75,200** |
| **Operating Margin** | **62.7%** |

### After Hiring AM + PM ($170K combined annual)

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Revenue | $120,000 |
| Core Team | $6,300 |
| Contract Labor | $28,000 |
| Account Manager | $9,600/mo |
| Project Manager | $6,700/mo |
| Operating | $10,500 |
| **Total Expenses** | **$61,100** |
| **Net Operating Income** | **$58,900** |
| **Operating Margin** | **49.1%** |

**This is still very healthy.** You can afford both hires once the new deals close.

## Hiring Sequence & Triggers

### Rule: Only hire when revenue triggers are hit

| Hire | Revenue Trigger | Annual Cost | Monthly Cost |
|------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Account Manager | $110K/month | $100K-$150K | $8.3K-$12.5K |
| Project Manager | $120K/month | $60K-$80K | $5K-$6.7K |

### Why This Sequence?

**Account Manager First:**
- You need someone to own client relationships so you can sell
- AM frees you from day-to-day client communication
- AM can help expand existing accounts (cheaper than new clients)
- AM protects Peddle relationship (52% of revenue concentration)

**Project Manager Second:**
- PM takes over delivery coordination
- PM manages contractors and workflows
- PM ensures quality doesn't slip during growth
- PM lets you fully exit operations

## 30/60/90 Day Plan

### Days 1-30: Close the Deals, Prep for AM Hire

**Revenue Focus:**
- Close the two pending deals ($25K combined)
- This gets you to ~$120K/month revenue
- At $120K, you've hit BOTH hiring triggers

**Hiring Prep:**
- Write Account Manager job description
- Define scope: client communication, QBRs, upsells, relationship protection
- Start recruiting (LinkedIn, Built In, referrals)
- Budget: $100K-$120K salary is the sweet spot for quality

**Operations:**
- Document all client communication patterns
- Create handoff playbook for AM
- Identify which clients need most attention

### Days 31-60: Hire AM, Start PM Search

**If Deals Closed:**
- Hire Account Manager (target: Day 45)
- AM starts onboarding: shadow client calls, learn accounts
- Begin Project Manager search

**If Deals Delayed:**
- Do not hire AM yet
- Continue nurturing deals
- Use this time to refine job descriptions and interview candidates

**AM Onboarding (2-week sprint):**
- Week 1: Shadow all client calls, learn context, meet team
- Week 2: Start owning communication on 2-3 smaller accounts
- Week 3: Take over all client communication except Peddle
- Week 4: Begin managing Peddle with your oversight

### Days 61-90: Hire PM, Exit Operations

**PM Hire:**
- Target hire: Day 75
- PM owns: contractor coordination, project timelines, delivery quality
- PM reports to you (or AM once established)

**Your New Role:**
- Strategy and sales (70%)
- Key relationship oversight (20%)
- Team leadership (10%)

**By Day 90:**
- AM owns all client relationships
- PM owns all delivery operations
- You're out of day-to-day execution
- Focus shifts to: winning new clients, expanding existing accounts

## The Bonus Structure

### Philosophy
Bonuses are paid quarterly, ONLY when the company hits margin targets. This aligns everyone with profitability, not just activity.

### Mechanics

**Eligibility:** Quarterly margin >= 30%

**Bonus Pool:** 10% of quarterly Net Operating Income

**Distribution:** Based on role weight x individual performance score (1-5)

| Role | Weight | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Account Manager | 2.5x | Revenue protection/expansion |
| Operations/Core Team | 2.0x | Maya's level |
| Project Manager | 2.0x | Delivery quality |
| Media/Specialists | 1.5x | Santi's level |
| Contractors | 1.0x | Shared pool |

### Example: Q2 2026

- Quarterly Revenue: $360K
- Quarterly Expenses: $200K
- Quarterly NOI: $160K
- Margin: 44% (exceeds 30% threshold)
- Bonus Pool: $16,000

**Distribution (assuming full team):**
- AM (2.5 x 4 = 10 points): ~$5,500
- Maya (2.0 x 4 = 8 points): ~$4,400
- PM (2.0 x 4 = 8 points): ~$4,400
- Santi (1.5 x 4 = 6 points): ~$3,300
- Contractors (shared): Distribute contractor pool based on hours/contribution

### Quarterly Review Process

1. **Day 1-5:** Close the quarter's books
2. **Day 5:** Calculate margin, determine if bonus pool is funded
3. **Day 6-10:** Rate each team member 1-5 on performance
4. **Day 10:** Calculate individual bonus amounts
5. **Day 15:** Communicate and pay bonuses

## Client Service Quality Framework

### The Standard: Premium Service, No Exceptions

You're charging premium rates ($250/hr with Alo). You need to deliver premium service.

**Weekly Client Touchpoints:**
- Status update email (automated or manual)
- 1 proactive recommendation per week minimum
- Same-day response to urgent requests

**Monthly:**
- Performance report with insights (not just data)
- Strategy discussion: what's working, what's not, what's next
- Budget vs. actual review

**Quarterly:**
- Full QBR with ROI documentation
- Competitive analysis update
- Next-quarter strategy proposal

### Who Owns What (After Hires)

| Activity | Owner | Backup |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Weekly status emails | AM | PM |
| Client calls | AM | You (for Peddle) |
| Performance reports | PM | AM |
| Strategy recommendations | You | AM |
| QBRs | AM + You | - |
| Day-to-day execution | PM + Contractors | - |
| Escalations | AM -> You | - |

## Financial Guardrails

### Cash Management Rules

1. **Minimum Cash Balance:** $50K always
2. **Invoice Terms:** Net 15 (not Net 30)
3. **AR Follow-up:** Day 16 if unpaid
4. **Payroll Priority:** Always funded 2 weeks ahead

### Expense Approval

- < $500: Team member can approve
- $500-$2,000: AM or PM approves
- > $2,000: You approve
- New recurring subscriptions: Always you

### Revenue Protection

- Peddle is 52% of revenue: AM must have weekly touchpoint, you must have monthly call
- Any client showing reduced engagement: Immediate escalation
- Any budget cut request: Counter with value demonstration before accepting

## Risk Scenarios

### If One Deal Falls Through

- Revenue stays at ~$107K/month (with one new client)
- Still above $110K trigger for AM: Proceed with AM hire
- Delay PM hire until you close another client
- Margin still healthy: ~55%

### If Both Deals Fall Through

- Revenue stays at ~$95K/month
- Below hiring triggers: Do NOT hire yet
- Focus 100% on closing new business
- Consider reducing contractor hours to boost margin
- You stay in operations until you hit $110K

### If Peddle Churns (Worst Case)

- Revenue drops to ~$46K/month
- Immediate actions:
  - Pause all hiring
  - Reduce contractors to essential only (~$10K/month)
  - You go back into full operations
  - Aggressive sales push
- Survival mode until you rebuild revenue

## Using the Financial Model

### Monthly Ritual (Every 1st of Month)

1. Open **Monthly Tracker** sheet
2. Update **Actual** column with real numbers from QuickBooks
3. Review variances: anything >10% needs investigation
4. Update **Assumptions** sheet if anything changed (client rates, team costs)
5. Check **Dashboard** for hiring triggers and margin health

### When Considering a Hire

1. Check **Dashboard**: Are revenue triggers met?
2. Check **Projection**: What happens to margin after hire?
3. If margin stays >35%, proceed
4. If margin drops below 35%, wait for more revenue

### Quarterly Bonus Time

1. Open **Bonus Structure** sheet
2. Update Quarter Revenue and Expenses with actuals
3. Rate each team member 1-5
4. Sheet calculates individual bonuses automatically
